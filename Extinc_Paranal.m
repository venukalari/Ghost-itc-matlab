%
%   Calculate attenuation due to atmospheric extinction, for Gemini South.
%   Use data from Paranal:  Patat et al AA 527 AA91 2011.
%   The output is fractional throughput, *not* magnitudes.
%
%   Input parameters:
%   -----------------
%   lambda_in   : single value or vector of wavelength values, in *nm*
%   ZD          : zenith distance of the observation, in *degrees*
%   plotQ       : 1 for plot, 0 for no plot
%
%   Output parameters:
%   ------------------
%   frac_out    : row vector giving fractional throughput of the atmosphere, 
%                   range 0 - 1, same length as lambda_in
